## 🛡️ Bot Permission Scope

- Report the bot ID to us immediately
- Do **not** invite unknown Kaeru forks into your server

## 🧠 Security Philosophy

Kaeru is designed to empower, not exploit. We favor:

- Transparency over obscurity
- Auditability over blind trust
- Community-driven safeguards

We appreciate any effort that contributes to a safer platform for all users.
